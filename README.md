# Libvirt-wrapper

libvirt-wrapper simplifies creation of VM's with libvirtd.

My default, running the script will set up an Alma 9.1 VM, but if you replace the default kickstart with your own and edit the vm.ini file you can change it as you like.

# Usage
```
python libvirt-wrapper.py
```


# Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
